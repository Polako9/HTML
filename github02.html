            SVG- is an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics
            with support for interactivity and animation.SVG images and their
            behaviors are defined in XML text files. This means that they can be searched,
            indexed, scripted, and compressed. As XML files, SVG images
            can be created and edited with any text editor, as well as with drawing software.

            GIF- or Graphic Interchange Format, is a file extension
            for an often animated raster graphics file and is the second most common image format used on the
            World Wide Web after JPEG. GIF uses the LZW compression algorithm and is owned by Unisys.
            <br>
            <br>
            JPG- is a file extension for a lossy graphics file.
            The JPEG file extension is used interchangeably with JPG.
            JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group who created the standard.
            JPG files have 2 sub-formats, JPG/Exif (often used in
            digital cameras and photographic equipment), and JPG/JFIF (often used on the World Wide Web).

            PNG-  is a file format for image compression that, in time, is expected to replace the Graphics
            Interchange Format (GIF) that is widely used on today's Internet.
            Owned by Unisys, the GIF format and its usage in image-handling software involves
            licensing or other legal considerations. (Web users can make, view, and send
            GIF files freely but they can't develop software that builds them without an
            arrangement with Unisys.) The PNG format, on the other hand, was developed by
            an Internet committee expressly to be patent-free.
            It provides a number of improvements over the GIF format.
